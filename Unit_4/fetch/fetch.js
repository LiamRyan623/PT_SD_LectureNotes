/* 
    ? API
    - Application Programming Interface
    - Wonderful way to access data we are trying to obtain
        - Data that is not in our local project.
        - Ex: data stored in database, cloud storage, or someone else's public database(via a public API)
    - Allows the Client (front end of the application, web page, program) to communicate with the/a server(database)
    - Allows HTTP requests and response lifecycle.
*/

/* 
    ? AJAX
    - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
    - Might see if working with older code bases
    - Wrap XML with XMLHttpRequests -> not important to know right now
    - Governs different aspects of our page, such as static vs dynamic section of our page.
    Pros:
        - Page components loaded individually
        - New data updated regularly
    Cons:
        - JS must be enabled
        - Adds more complex aspects.
        - refreshes the page state and stores info can bloat.
        - Difficulty for screen readers.
    - Works through multiple technologies
        - HTML / CSS
        - DOM (Document Object Model)
        - JSON
        - Fetch
        - JS bringing it all together
    - Not Promised based.
    *jQuery
        - AJAX often works with it
        - A library that helps us handle the front end.
        - Prior to DOM and Fetch
        - still used but dated
    example:
        - timed updates to comments (replies)
        - infinite scrolling
        - dynamic search results

/* 
    ? Fetch
    - Before fetch(), we would have had to use an httpRequest through the above noted system^

    - Is an API
    - A global method that requires one argument.
        - The location of the data (URL) we are trying to obtain
    - Handles both the request and response.
    - Returns a Promise
        - Allows us to access our resolvers (chain .then()/.catch())
        - Resolvers = okay, got the thing (or didn't), hey code, now perform this next action.

    /* 
        ? JSON (what we used above^)
        - JavaScript Object Notation
            - very lightweight way to store and transfer data
            - "Easy to understand/read" (for us humans)
            - Structured like an object

        }

        - Everything is wrapped in quotes with minor exceptions ( integers / booleans )
        - Data is all separated with commas
        - CANNOT hold comments or functions

        - .json() method helps to convert our promise response into something usable (object)

/* 
The Process:
        1. Fetch your resource which returns a promise
        2. Use a .then() resolver to catch fetches return and assign to a parameter.
        3. use .json() on response to finish reading entire ReadableStream.
        4. Chained another .then() to catch read response object and ..
        5. Build the rest as needed.
            - DOM manipulation
            - use data to process in other functions
            - whatever your project requires.
    Fetch differs from jQuery:
        - The promise returned won't reject on HTTP error status even even if its a 404 or 500 (internal / external server error)
